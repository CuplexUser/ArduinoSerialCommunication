# ArduinoDataServecis
Arduino Serial data communication using the viertual COM port that is created when an Arduino compatible device is connected.
Some minor features remains to be implemented like, save and load user options which are set to defaults and COM port is also set based on what is connected to the computer.

I was planning on expanding this repository with different media types like, blutooth, Ethernet, WiFi, IR etc.
